              Mountain Biking is the sport of riding bicycles off-road, often over rough terrain, on specially designed mountain bikes. It is a fun activity that is accessible to anyone with access to a suitable bike and a desire to explore the outdoors.
              <br>
              <br>
              A Trail Centre is a network of manmade mountain bike trails and often has on site facilities such as parking, a café, bike shop, bike wash, toilets and showers. The trail network itself will typically be made up of a mixture of graded trails to suit all abilities from novice to experienced cyclists. Trail centres are normally situated in a hilly location with a mixture of forest and open hillside.
              <br>
              <br>
              The Benefits of mountain bike trail centres are far reaching. There are the substantial health benefits that come from increased participation in cycling. In addition to this, trail centres increase visitor numbers to local areas, create employment, inspire people to enjoy the outdoors, encourage a positive social pastime, provide a significant economic benefit and can even be linked to a reduction in crime.
              <br>
              <br>
              There is a Geographical Gap in Scotland with regards to trail centres. The adjacent image shows the distribution of trial centres in Scotland in relation to the main population centres. The dots in red show large major trail centres and the yellow dots show small trail centres or trail networks. Scotland is a world leader in providing purpose built trail centres and in hosting world class mountain biking events. There are many high quality large trail centres throughout the South and West of Scotland, however there is a clear gap in the North East region of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire. This Gap has been recognised by Scottish Cycling, Sportscotland, Scottish Enterprise and VisitScotland as well as the Aberdeenshire Forestry Commission and is highlighted as an issue to address in the National Strategic Framework for Mountain Biking Development.
              <br>
              <br>
              NETCO (North East Trail Centre Organisation) was set up in April 2015 with the aim of filling this geographical gap and bringing a high quality, large national level trail centre to the area. It is the intention of NETCO to develop a trail centre that caters for cyclists of all ages and abilities whilst also providing all of the facilities found at similar scale trail centres elsewise in Scotland. This will be a significant benefit to the people of Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire and will also attract visitors from surrounding regions and the rest of the UK.
              <br>
              <br>
              A Survey was carried out during March 2015 to establish the level of public interest and support for the project. The survey received over 2000 responses with over 99% of the respondents confirming that they would like to have a purpose built trail centre in the North East of Scotland. 520 people said they would like to be involved with a development group and 532 took the time to write comments supporting the project.
              <br>
              <br>
              How will NETCO go about achieving this project vision? To the right is a summary of the various steps in the process, from initial concept through to final build and maintenance. To date, NETCO has registered as a SCIO charity and appointed it's board members. Our business plan and project summary have been developed and are working documents as we refine our plan. The next steps are to complete a feasibility study and generate funds to have this carried out by an impartial independent consultancy firm. We will then be working towards the development of the centre and associated facilities.
              <br>
              <br>
              Our Aims as a charity are to:
              <br>
              <br>
              1. Increase participation in mountain biking<br>
              2. Cater for a range of abilities, from beginners and children to experienced bikers<br>
              3. Provide a training venue for competitive riders<br>
              4. Offer a year­round sporting venue<br>
              5. Act as a hub for various complementary recreational and educational outdoor activities<br>
              6. Bring visitors to the Aberdeen area<br>
              7. Promote appreciation of the outdoors<br>
              8. Create employment
              <br>
              <br>
              Thanks for you support and see you on the trails soon!</p>
